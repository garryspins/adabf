# Brainfuck in Ada
This is purely a learning project for myself, I've wanted to get into Ada for a long time and I thought this was a fitting first project as it's the first thing I do in most languages.

This (should) be a fully functional implementation of the language heh

## Tests
Used the tests [here](https://github.com/rdebath/Brainfuck/tree/master/testing)
